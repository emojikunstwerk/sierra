    *for simplicity re: exporting data, decided to use all of CA instead of subselecting all the sierra-specific watersheds

        "Unlike the main crest of the Sierra Nevada to the west of Lake Tahoe, 
        the Carson Range loses its snow much earlier (April), and gains it much 
        later (December). In fact, it receives about half the snowfall as 
        mountains west of the lake."

        the carson range is essentially the eastern side of lake tahoe, stretching between carson valley north to reno

    + run in three reports
        + california
        + HUC 16050101
        + HUC 16050102
    + stacked time series, monthly

        - export is fragile (timeout), collect one year at a time (for CA, at least)
        - dont know for sure (yet) if the date boundaries are inclusive (i expect they are)
